        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Kenneth Salas. I am 23 years old and currently attending UCR with the plan of graduating with my bachelors in Sociology. I have had multiple jobs that require different skill sets whether it be working in a fast paced environment that is fast food or a much slower experience such as being a behavioral technician working with mentally challenged children that exhibited abnormal behaviors in an attempt to help them tackle their everyday challenges.<br><br>

        I am a dedicated and consistent worker that is willing to learn for the sake of new experiences. I intend to seek job experience within the field of sociology as a means to gain further knowledge for the end goal of becoming a social worker. I am very sociable, being capable of conversing and cooperating with most people I am working with. I am dependable, especially when it counts. After working through the entirety of the pandemic, I learned how to adapt to drastic changes in both work and in human relations. For each job that I had, I have been told that I am reliable and trustworthy. Whenever an important task needed to be finished, I was the one that usually handled it in order to stay on track for the daily agenda. I have multiple years of working retail which has allowed me to gain a better understanding of customer relations.<br><br>

        Aside from work, as a student, I am a fast learner and focused on achieving my goal of being the first of my family to graduate college. I do my best whenever I can to stay on track, maintaining a proper balance between work, school, and home life. Throughout my years of school I managed to hold a solid GPA in order to progress. During highschool I graduated with the top 15% of my class having got honor roll multiple years in a row all while dealing with the fact that I just got placed in FosterCare. Being separated from my family, I was able to take care of my little sister and grew a greater understanding of how to basically be an adult at the age of 15. I can promise that I am dedicated to whatever job I am currently working at and am willing to put in the time to prove my worth. If given the opportunity, I believe I can make it worth your time. <br><br>
        Some fun facts about me, is that I am quite humorous and caring as I am a parent to a little furball that goes by the name of Aggy, short for Agatha. I enjoy art and am a big cinephile. One of my favorite films has to be Asteroid City by Wes Anderson. I also am a big fan of works by Studio Ghibli and other household names. I also enjoy playing video games and going out with friends to new restaurants.
